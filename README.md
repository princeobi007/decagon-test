# decagon-test

This is my implementation of the account-manager solution as described https://docs.google.com/document/d/15G0lHOaNHFvrT48Vi4oJANi3FJD-K27Qsk_BHlsNDKc

#notes

1) after running the application, the UI can be found on http://localhost:4000/swagger-ui/. I figured it would be easier to use swagger to demo api functionalities. Please do not hesistate to raise an issue if this approach is not satisfactory.

I really enjoyed this assignment. 

Best Regards,
